    <h2>Cheat Sheet - Console Output</h2>

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>The console is a window in your Eclipse app that lets you output plain text and helps you debug your code.
            The console is accessed through some standard methods, which will be explained below.</p>
    </section>

        <h4>Printing text</h4>

        <p>To print out a line of text to the console, use the following method. Replace "Your message here" with your
            message, and make sure to keep the quotations.</p>
        <pre class="code">System.out.println("Your message here");</pre>

        <p>Using println automatically goes to the next line. To avoid this, use the following:</p>
        <pre class="code">System.out.print("Your message here");</pre>

        <p>In the string cheat sheet, you can find more information about what you can print out. You can also find
            information on the scanner cheat sheet about how to read input in as well.</p>

        <h4>Printing variables</h4>

        <p>Printing out variables is a little different than printing out text. To print out a variable, use the
            following:</p>
        <pre class="code">System.out.println(variableName);</pre>

        <p>Replace "variableName" with the name of the variable you want to print out. This will print out the value of
            the variable.</p>

        <p>You can always chain print statements together to print out a complex message. For example:</p>
        <pre class="code">String name="Nate";
int age="17";
System.out.println("My name is " 
    + name + " and I am " 
    + age + " years old.");
</pre>
        <p>Confused about what those plus signs are doing? No worries, check the strings cheat sheet.</p>
        </pre>
